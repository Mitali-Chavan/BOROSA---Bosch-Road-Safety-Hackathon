# Prelim Hackathon - Problem Statement

Design a two-wheeler surrounding awareness system for rider. This system should help 
in increased rider awareness and hence lesser accidents.

# Specifications

• Use up to 6 sensors to detect objects within 1.5 meter radius of the vehicle.

• Display the objects on a RADAR chart (object distance and angle from the rider position)

• Give audio alarm if the object is within 1 meter distance.

• No need to detect the objects in front 60 deg angle (driver can track these objects in 
normal driving)

• Centre of the circle being the rider position (see Slide-3(diagram) for the details)

# Success Criteria

The rider's safety is assured through a radar display and audible alerts, which promptly signal the presence of objects or vehicles within a 1.5-meter range. This system provides real-time visual cues and auditory warnings, ensuring heightened situational awareness for the rider in a concise and professional manner.

# Benefits

1) Enhanced Rider Safety

2) Improved Situational Awareness

3) Reduced Risk of Collisions

4) Minimal Distraction
